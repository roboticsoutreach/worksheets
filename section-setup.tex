\section{Setting up your environment}\label{setting-up-your-environment}

The m3pi robots need to be programmed using the ARM mbed platform, which
can be accessed at \url{https://os.mbed.com/}.

You will need to create an account on the mbed website, this can be done
using the ``Sign Up'' link on the page above.

Once your account has been created, you will need to add the
\lstinline!mbed LPC1768! compiler to your account, this can be found on
the \href{https://os.mbed.com/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/}{page for the
LPC1768}.

You can then navigate to the compiler and create a new project. We now
need to add the \lstinline!m3pi! library. Click import on the top left
of the bar and search for \lstinline!m3pi!. Once this is added, the
\lstinline!m3pi! library will be available.
