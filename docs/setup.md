# Setting up your environment

The m3pi robots need to be programmed using the ARM mbed platform, which can be accessed at [https://os.mbed.com/](https://os.mbed.com/).

You will need to create an account on the mbed website, this can be done using the "Sign Up" link on the page above.

Once your account has been created, you will need to add the `mbed LPC1768` compiler to your account, this can be found on the [page for the LPC1768](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/).

You can then navigate to the compiler and create a new project. We now need to add the `m3pi` library. Click import on the top left of the bar and search for `m3pi`. Once this is added, the `m3pi` library will be available.
